# Da Grape Vine Media Website

This is the official website for Da Grape Vine, a start-up for-profit news media and entertainment company based in Providence, Rhode Island, committed to amplifying the voices, stories, and realities of inner-city, minority, and underrepresented communities.

## About Da Grape Vine

Da Grape Vine provides raw, authentic, and culturally resonant content that covers local news, politics, court systems, education, music, nightlife, and community life across cities like Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.

Founded by CEO Kendall Johnson, Da Grape Vine was built on the belief that our communities deserve more than mainstream media narrativesâ€”we deserve the truth and the juice, told from our lens, in our voice.
